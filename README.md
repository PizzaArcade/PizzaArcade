# PizzaArcade

Pizza Arcade was started by Robert Ely to explore his interests in physical computing and love of vintage games. 

We are currently in the early stages of prototyping an open-source Raspberry Pi-based portable handheld gaming module. We want everyone to be able to play their favorite games, any time. Stay tuned for more information on our project!

Oh, and we love pizza.
